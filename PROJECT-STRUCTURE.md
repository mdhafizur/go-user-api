## Explanation of Project Structure

- **/cmd**: This directory contains the application-specific command-line entry points. In this case, `api-server` is the main entry point for your API.

- **/pkg**: The `pkg` directory holds the core logic of your application, and it can be imported by other projects. It includes subdirectories for different functional parts of your application, such as `api`, `database`, and `logger`.

    - **/pkg/api**: This directory contains the API-related code, such as the main API setup, middleware, and route definitions.

    - **/pkg/database**: Code related to database connections, migrations, and operations.

    - **/pkg/logger**: Logging related code.

- **/internal**: This directory is for code that is specific to your application and should not be imported by other projects. It includes subdirectories like `app` for your application-specific logic and `config` for configuration-related code.

    - **/internal/app**: This directory contains application-specific code, such as handlers and models.

    - **/internal/config**: Configuration-related code.

- **/scripts**: This directory can contain scripts for setting up your development environment or other utility scripts.

- **/web**: This directory can contain static files and templates for your web server, if applicable.

- **/config**: Configuration files for your application. This can include environment-specific configuration files.

- **Dockerfile**: If you're using Docker, this file defines how your application should be containerized.

- **.env**: Environment variable configuration file.

- **.gitignore**: Git ignore file to exclude certain files and directories from version control.

- **go.mod and go.sum**: Go module files.

This structure provides a good starting point, but you may need to customize it based on your specific requirements. Additionally, consider using a framework like Gin or Echo to simplify building your API in Go.
